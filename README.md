# Bulb_ON-OFF

This is my first project using DOM Manipulation
When you click on "Turn ON" button then the light will go ON (in the background image is changed)
And button Text will also changed from "Turn ON" to "Turn OFF"
Now you see the "light Bulb and Turn OFF on button"
When you clicked on button again then the " Light will blow up and button text also changed to Trun ON" and so on
